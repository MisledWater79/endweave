# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- CraftingData decode crash on chemistry recipes: ShapedChemistry and ShapelessChemistry do not carry a RecipeUnlockingRequirement on the wire.
- Enchantment table showing no options for 1.26.20 clients on 1.26.10 servers.
- Locator bar waypoints not appearing for 1.26.20 clients on 1.26.10 servers.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Server-reported PacketViolationWarning is now surfaced as a warning-level log so malformed-packet diagnostics are visible without enabling debug.
- Failing packet payloads are dumped to `<plugin-data>/crashes/*.bin` and the path is logged so operators can attach the file when reporting issues.

### Fixed
- ActorEvent from 1.26.20 clients carrying a trailing Fire At Position field that 1.26.10 servers reject.
- InventorySlot misreading the FullContainerName Dynamic ID as a uvarint instead of an optional uint32, which corrupted the rest of the packet and crashed 1.26.20 clients on dynamic-container interactions (e.g. bundles).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- CraftingData packet failing to decode on 1.26.10 servers.
- ClientMovementPredictionSync from 1.26.20 clients carrying three new attribute floats that 1.26.10 servers reject.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- Protocol translation for 1.26.20 (clients running 1.26.20 or later can now join 1.26.10 servers)
- Update checker that polls GitHub releases on startup and notifies operators on join (configurable via `check-for-updates` in `config.toml`)

### Fixed
- Editor mode packets causing decode errors and disconnects across mismatched 1.26.0 and 1.26.10 versions
- Volume entity spawn packets corrupted between 1.26.0 and 1.26.10 (broke fog, border, and other volume effects spawned by scripts or commands)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- Block registry checksum not zeroed in some version pairs, causing clients to reject the world

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- Sound effects not playing correctly for 1.21.124 clients on newer servers
- Sound remapping missing for 1.21.130 clients connecting to 1.26.0 servers
- Server protocol detection failing when the server runs a Minecraft version not explicitly known to the plugin (e.g. a hotfix release like 1.26.11)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Protocol translation for v898 (MC 1.21.130), v860 (MC 1.21.124), and v859 (MC 1.21.120)
- Bidirectional translation (older clients can also join newer servers that have the plugin)

### Fixed
- 1.21.120/1.21.124 clients disconnecting immediately when joining 1.26.0 servers
- Animation glitches for 1.21.120/1.21.124 clients on newer servers
- Lectern page turning not working across version boundaries
- Running commands (e.g. /list) disconnecting 1.21.x clients on 1.26.0 servers
- Dismounting rides sometimes causing a disconnect
- Signs could not be edited or dyed by 1.26.10 clients on 1.26.0 servers
- Block actor interactions (e.g. editing command blocks) failing for 1.26.0 clients on 1.26.10 servers
- Script debug shapes not rendering for cross-version clients
- Client diagnostics packet causing errors when connecting across 1.21.130/1.26.0 boundary

### Changed
- Startup log now shows supported client version range instead of listing each version

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Block interactions (chests, signs, etc.) failing at Y < 0 due to NetworkBlockPosition reading Y as unsigned

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- CameraSpline packet handler appending trailing bytes instead of per-spline fields, breaking login when `experimental_creator_cameras` is enabled
- CameraInstruction packet missing v944 spline fields (splineIdentifier, loadFromJson)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- ContainerOpen packet registered as serverbound instead of clientbound, preventing v944 clients from opening chests and other containers
- bStats OS architecture not normalized across platforms

### Changed
- Dev build versions shortened

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- ActorData CompoundTag parsing and Int64 remapping
- bStats metrics reporting incorrect platform and plugin data

### Changed
- License changed from MIT to Apache 2.0

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Sound event remapping so v944 clients hear the correct sounds on v924 servers
- Data-Driven UI screen packet translation (show/close screens)
- bStats metrics integration
- Improved error reporting with structured context for easier debugging
- Debug logging with packet filtering (configurable in `config.toml`)

### Changed
- Startup logs now show supported client version range

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- Protocol translation between v924 (MC 1.26.0) and v944 (MC 1.26.10)
- Automatic client version detection and protocol rewriting
- Coordinate format conversion for all affected packets
- Sound instrument remapping for note blocks
- Server list ping version spoofing so newer clients see the server
- Per-player connection tracking
- Protocol chaining support for future multi-version translation
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
