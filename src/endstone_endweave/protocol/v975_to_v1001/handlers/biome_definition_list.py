"""BiomeDefinitionList (122) clientbound handler for the v975 -> v1001 delta.

Protocol 1001 (MC 1.26.30) restructured the nested BiomeChunkGeneration body. The
outer packet (Varuint32 biome count + trailing StringList) and the per-biome
header (NameIndex i16, BiomeID i16, 5 floats, MapWaterColour i32, Rain bool,
optional Tags) are UNCHANGED v975<->v1001. Only the Optional[BiomeChunkGeneration]
body changed:

  v975 wrote the surface span INLINE between SurfaceMaterialAdjustments and
  OverworldRules: SurfaceMaterials?, 4 surface bools, MesaSurface?, CappedSurface?.

  v1001 REMOVES that span from the middle and appends two new optionals at the
  tail (after VillageType): SurfaceBuilder (Optional[BiomeSurfaceBuilder]) and
  SubsurfaceBuilder (Optional[BiomeSurfaceBuilder]), where BiomeSurfaceBuilder =
  { SurfaceMaterials?, 4 bools, MesaSurface?, CappedSurface?, NoiseGradientSurface? }.

v944 biome.go == v975 biome.go byte-for-byte (gophertunnel v1.55.2 vs v1.56.2),
and endweave models that body as the *v924* chunk-gen (inline surface span +
trailing village_type), so ``BIOME_DEFINITION_V924`` decodes the real BDS bytes.
This handler reads each biome with that model and re-emits the chunk-gen body in
v1001 wire order, relocating the surface span into a present SurfaceBuilder
(NoiseGradientSurface absent) and writing an absent SubsurfaceBuilder (a v975
server never produces noise-gradient or subsurface data). SurfaceBuilder is
written PRESENT for every biome because the v975 span was always serialised --
this is lossless and matches Mojang's migration of the always-present span.

Field order and array-vs-single for every chunk-gen field were validated against
gophertunnel v1.56.2 minecraft/protocol/biome.go (ReplacementsData and the
surface-adjustment/consolidated/legacy fields are bool-prefixed SLICES; the rest
are single optionals). As a safety net this handler reads the trailing StringList
explicitly and asserts the input is fully consumed: if the decode model is ever
off by a byte the packet raises (caught by the pipeline, which dumps the payload)
rather than silently emitting a malformed list.

Mirrors the shape of v898_to_v924/handlers/biome_definition_list.py.
